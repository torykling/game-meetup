## Board Game Meetups!

### Description
This application is called bgm, or Board Game Meetups. The idea is to be able to create events centered around a specific game and sign up with a location (using the Google Maps API) in mind so you and your friends can meet up and play! This was the result of a group project completed during the Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly in a couple days. The back end of this project involving our board game API and routing can be found [in this directory.](https://github.com/shelbyvjacobs/game-meetup-api)

### Approach 
Since this was a group project, we wanted to take an approach that would complement our skillsets. With this project, we wanted to focus on making an elegantly styled site that ran smoothly with user consideration in mind. Our big goal was to ensure CRUD functionality was performing smoothly in React.
